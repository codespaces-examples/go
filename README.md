# Minimal Go (Golang) Codespaces starter template

Welcome, Gopher! This repository is a minimal template for you to use in your next (or existing) Go project so you can take advantage of [Visual Studio Codespaces](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/visual-studio-codespaces/), or the brand-new [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).

This is an updated and stripped down version of the official Go codespace example.

You get:
- latest and greatest Go 1.20
- Visual Studio Code Go Plugin (including dependencies)

## How to get started on a new repository

The easiest way to get started is on a new repository. For that, simply click on the green "Use this template" button, right above the list of files.

After you do, a list of options for creating a _new_ repository will pop up. After you're done, a brand new repository will be created for you, wherever you told it to. And it'll be pre-populated with everything you need to be up and running with Codespaces.
