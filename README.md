# Go (Golang) Codespaces starter template

Welcome, Gopher! This repository is a template for you to use in your next (or existing) Go project so you can take advantage of [Visual Studio Codespaces](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/visual-studio-codespaces/), or the brand-new [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).

## How to get started on a new repository

The easiest way to get started is on a new repository. For that, simply click on the green "Use this template" button, right above the list of files.

After you do, a list of options for creating a _new_ repository will pop up. After you're done, a brand new repository will be created for you, wherever you told it to. And it'll be pre-populated with everything you need to be up and running with Codespaces.

## Testing this out

This template sets up Go entirely inside a Docker image. To test it, make sure you have [Docker](https://docker.com) installed and run the below command from the root of this repository:

```console
$ cd .devcontainer
$ docker build .
$ cd ..
```

>When you run the command, make sure to remove the leading `$`

## Built on the Shoulders of Giants

Like almost every developer who contributes to open source, I didn't write this code in a vacuum. I had help! Thank you to the following contributors for helping me build this:

- [`bnb`](https://github.com/bnb) for code from [codespaces-examples/node](https://github.com/codespaces-examples/node
)
- [`asw101`](https://github.com/asw101) for code from [`asw101/hello-vso`](https://github.com/asw101/hello-vso)

I took inspiration, and sometimes code, from their repositories.

>I took code and ideas _directly_ from these developers' repositories. There are countless other projects and technologies that this repository implicitly relies on, and the list of contributors behind those projects is too long to write here. Thank you to every one of those contributors.
